<h1>February Meetup</h1>

<p><strong>Heads up! This is a remote meetup taking place over Zoom - Please RSVP for the URL.</strong></p>

<p>This event will be hosted in collaboration with MidlandsJS at <a href="https://midlandsjs.org/">https://midlandsjs.org/</a></p>  

<p>This month, we have a talk by Elle Townsend - For The Love Of APIs. APIs are everywhere nowadays, so it's more important than ever to get to the bottom of what they are, and how they work. In this talk, I want to take you on a tour of modern APIs, how you can use them and how to approach developing your own!<p>

<p>We'll also continue adding to the cool wall - virtually. Share your highs with your favourite technologies and tales of woe with others.</p>

<p>We can't wait to see you all. Please RSVP and you'll get the Zoom link :)</p>
