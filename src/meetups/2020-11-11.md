Heads up! This is a remote meetup taking place over Zoom - Please RSVP for the URL.

We have two fantastic talks for you this month!

Louis Quaintance: Amplify & Cognito

We're proud to host join Louis to learn more about AWS Amplify & Cognito, and how you can use them to build fast and responsive mobile and web apps that scale.

And...

James Vickery: Digging into Deno, a New JS & TS Runtime

From James(@jmsve): Node.js revolutionised web development by making it easy to run JavaScript outside of the browser - however, the creator of Node is now developing a replacement runtime called Deno. This talk will dig into why Deno exists, and how to get started!

We can't wait to hear this talk and see you all. Please RSVP and you'll get the Zoom link :)
